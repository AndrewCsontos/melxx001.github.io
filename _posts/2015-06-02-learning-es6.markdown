## ES6 \(ES2015\)

 So I'm trying to use ES6 and keepup with the times. I need to get up to speed quickly so I google it and read many docs. I fugure to write about it here and have one location where I can reference what i've learn and actual examples that I can play with.


### Requirements

~~~ javascript
var test = function(e){
	return 1;
}
~~~
