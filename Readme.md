# Purpose

This is my personal site where I will blog about interests and things about what I've learnt.

Currently, these will mostly include React.js, Node.js and ES6.

## Theme 

For this site, I modified the theme created by [Jerome Lachaud](https://github.com/jeromelachaud/freelancer-theme). Which itself is based on template by [Iron Summit Media Strategies](https://github.com/IronSummitMedia/startbootstrap-freelancer)
